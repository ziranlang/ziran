# Ziran

Ziran is a general-purpose language that compiles to C, C++, Go, Rust, and
Python. The toolchain checks source, saves checked modules, and builds portable
programs you can run without a native compiler.

[Website & playground](https://ziran-lang.org/) · [Compiler guide](docs/USAGE.md) · [Implementation status](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)

The compiler and portable runner are under active development. Language
coverage and target limits are listed in the implementation status.

## Try it

```jai
main :: () {
    print("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

Edit and run this example in the [browser playground](https://ziran-lang.org/).

## Quick start

You need Make, a C11 compiler, and GNU binutils. From the repository root:

```sh
make
build/bin/ziran bundle --root site/examples --entry hello:main \
  -o build/hello.zib site/examples/hello.zi
build/bin/ziran run build/hello.zib
```

This prints `Hello, World!`. To install the `ziran` command for your user, run
`make install-user` and add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`. Then start a
project from a template and run it:

```sh
ziran new hello          # or --template lib, or a package's template
cd hello
ziran run -- Ada         # Hello, Ada!
```

See [packages and projects](docs/PACKAGES.md) for templates, dependencies,
and `ziran build`/`install`.

## Tools and formats

Use `build/bin/ziran` from the checkout, or `ziran` after installation.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `check` | Validate source and imports. |
| `build` | Generate C, C++, Go, Rust, or Python output. |
| `ir` / `inspect` | Save checked modules and read their contents. |
| `bundle` / `run` | Build and run portable programs; `run --target=py FILE.zi -- ARGS` runs Python-target scripts. |
| `fmt` | Format source files. |
| `guide` / `features` / `capabilities` | Explore syntax, support, and target limits. |
| `api` | Query public declarations as JSON. |

Source files use `.zi`, checked modules use [`.zir`](docs/ZIR.md), and portable
programs use [`.zib`](docs/ZIB.md). Native targets and the portable runner have
different limits; the Plan 9 C target is experimental.

When an existing native C file includes a generated Plan 9 header after
`<u.h>` and `<libc.h>`, define `ZIR_PLAN9_NATIVE_HEADERS_INCLUDED` first.
Plan 9's native headers have no include guards; this avoids including them
again through the generated runtime header.

## Standard library

The library includes text and UTF-8 helpers, generic values, sorting, queues,
JSON scanning, ZIP archives, and explicit HTTP and process capabilities.
Native Linux adapters provide file, socket, timer, and other system operations.

See the [standard library reference](https://ziran-lang.org/stdlib.html) and
[compiler guide](docs/USAGE.md#standard-library) for imports and platform limits.

Kryon is a separate UI library that applications import explicitly.

## Development

Run `make check` for the language, backend, and portable runtime checks.
Tests use four workers by default; set `CHECK_JOBS=1` to run them serially.

The native command and formatter are written in Ziran. Compiler scanners,
declaration, foreign binding, and `using` modifier syntax, enum validation and
evaluation, type spelling and field parsing, expression and nested initializer
grammar, statement expression extraction, loop headers, optional `then`, and
compile-time branch syntax are also written in Ziran. Ziran also parses multiple
results and bindings, normalizes procedure-type parameters, expands formatted
builder statements, and rewrites
symmetric operators, procedure-name expressions, and local procedure names.
The rest of the compiler is still being migrated from C.
A fresh build uses the generated modules in `bootstrap/` to build a bootstrap
compiler, then compiles their maintained `cmd/compiler_*.zi` sources for the
ordinary tools. Run
`make check-bootstrap` to verify that the generated seed matches the source.
After changing a compiler module, use `make update-bootstrap` to refresh its seed.
