# Runtime and compiler benchmarks

For compiler scaling, module graphs, generic specialization, and source/saved
IR validation, run:

```sh
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY python3 bench/compiler_scaling.py \
  --out build/benchmarks/compiler-scaling --sizes 8 32 128
```

The harness validates every C and portable result against an independent
checksum and records checking, saved IR, C emission, native compilation, and
execution separately. `--project /absolute/path/to/entry.zi` adds a real
package check using its package map. Results include source and binary hashes,
raw samples, a discarded warmup, tool versions, cache caveats, and compiler
profiles. Choose a new output directory for every run.

Set `ZIRAN_PROFILE=/absolute/path/to/profile.jsonl` for any compiler command to
append a process profile without changing ordinary output or JSON diagnostics.
Profiles contain inclusive parse/load/check/emission/IR-write times, record
field parsing and snapshot-reuse counts, peak RSS, and allocation-request counts for compiler
workspace allocations through `AllocateOrExit`. These allocations are a
subset, not total allocations or currently live bytes. Nested phase times
overlap and must not be summed into a claimed build duration; the harness
measures whole commands separately.

The October 3 field-snapshot comparison used module/generic sizes 8 and 32,
three measured repetitions, and checks of the real Kryon and Terminal packages
(162 validated measured samples per run). Kryon's field-parser calls fell
from 2,056,209 to 2,883 and Terminal's from 2,747,749 to 3,839. Whole-command check
medians were 515/537 ms for Kryon and 813/849 ms for Terminal (before/after), so this
run establishes elimination of repeated parsing, not a wall-clock speedup.
The machine was shared and both metadata records identify dirty working trees;
each records the actual tool hashes. Local raw samples are under
`build/benchmarks/compiler-fields-before-fixed` and
`build/benchmarks/compiler-fields-after`. Repeat on a stable machine before
using these timings as a regression threshold.

## Cross-target smoke benchmark

From the repository root, build the current toolchain and run:

```sh
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY make -j4 all
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY python3 bench/smoke.py
```

The script creates a new directory under `build/benchmarks/` with `metadata.json`,
`samples.jsonl`, `summary.json`, and `benchmark.md`. Pass `--out PATH` to select
a new output directory. `--compile-repetitions` and `--run-repetitions` adjust
the measured sample counts; each case also has one discarded warmup. The run
requires GCC, G++, Go and the Ziran tools. Rust, Java and Node comparisons are
included when their toolchains are present, and absences are recorded.

One integer recurrence is built from source and saved IR to C, C++, Go, and
portable `.zib`. The harness checks that generated source and bundles match,
and validates every runtime result against an independent modular-series
oracle before reporting times. It separately measures Ziran check/emission,
downstream native compilation, and whole-process execution. Runtime cases are
shuffled with a fixed seed between sample rounds. The portable VM runs only
the small input because its instruction budget excludes the large one.

These numbers are a smoke baseline, not a language ranking. They include
process startup; Go build measurements use a warm build cache and are labeled
accordingly. JIT languages are launched fresh rather than timed at warmed
steady state. The output records compiler revisions, source and tool hashes,
tool versions, commands, fixture hashes, raw timings, and limitations so that
a comparison can be checked against the exact experiment. A broader suite
still needs generics, larger module graphs, more compiler-scaling cases, and
real applications.

The first repeated baseline, including raw samples and machine metadata, is
in [`results/2026-09-27`](results/2026-09-27/benchmark.md). It used three
measured compile samples and five measured runtime samples per case on one
machine; its medians are not regression thresholds.

For a second workload that grows a `Vec(s32)` and then scans it, run:

```sh
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY python3 bench/vector_growth.py
```

This measures source and saved-IR checks and emissions to C, C++, Go, and
portable `.zib`, downstream native builds, and whole-process execution.
Handwritten C, C++, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, and Python versions provide
algorithm-level comparisons when their toolchains are installed; unavailable
tools are recorded explicitly. The checksum uses a closed-form arithmetic
oracle, and every runtime sample must match it. The portable VM runs the small
input only. Raw commands, samples,
source and tool hashes, and caveats are written alongside the report. These
workloads remain a smoke and collection baseline; they do not cover text,
records, generics, larger module graphs, or real applications.

The [vector-growth baseline](results/2026-09-27-vector-growth/benchmark.md)
contains three measured compilation and five measured execution samples per
case on one machine. The generated C and C++ runs were close to their
handwritten comparisons for the large input; generated Go took about 22 ms
versus 8 ms for handwritten Go. This identifies a workload for investigating
vector lowering, not a general performance ranking.

For a record-value and call workload over a fixed `[32]Point` table, run:

```sh
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY python3 bench/record_calls.py
```

Each round updates all records through a checked `Mix(Point, Point, s32, s32)`
call and accumulates a signed 64-bit checksum with wrapping `s32` field
arithmetic. The harness measures source and saved IR through C, C++, Go, Rust when Cargo is
installed, and portable `.zib`, downstream native builds, and whole-process execution.
Handwritten C, C++, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, and Python versions participate
when installed. Every sample must match an independent Python oracle; source
and saved-IR generated output and bundles are checked for equality. The VM runs
the small input only because the large input exceeds its instruction budget.
The [clean-head generated-Rust record-call baseline](results/2026-09-28-record-calls-rust/README.md)
contains 238 validated samples across 58 phase/case combinations. The
[earlier baseline](results/2026-09-28-record-calls/README.md) contains 206
samples across 50 combinations and predates generated-Rust participation.

For a focused before/after comparison of two validated Go binaries, run
`bench/vector_growth_ab.py --before PATH --after PATH --out NEW.json`. It
shuffles execution order, checks every checksum, and records raw samples and
binary hashes. A [paired fast-path result](results/2026-09-27-vector-growth-go-fastpath/README.md)
shows how the general arithmetic helper affected the vector workload.

A [provisional multilanguage matrix](results/2026-09-27-vector-growth-multilang/README.md)
adds Rust, Java, JavaScript, and Python comparisons after the Go arithmetic
fast path. Its metadata records the dirty working tree used for that run.

For a UTF-8 scanning workload over `aé中🙂`, run:

```sh
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY python3 bench/text_scan.py
```

The text has 10 bytes and 4 Unicode scalar values; every runtime sample must
return `148921 * rounds`. The harness compares Ziran source and saved IR to
C, C++, Go, Plan 9 C, and `.zib`, plus handwritten C, C++, Go, Rust, Java,
JavaScript, and Python when installed. It validates generated-source and
bundle equality, compares canonical Plan 9 dispatcher output with direct
`zi2c --target=plan9-c`, and records unavailable tools rather than estimating
them. When no Plan 9 compiler is installed, the harness still compiles the
emitted Plan 9 dialect with host GCC against a minimal fake Plan 9 libc and
marks those runtime samples as dialect validation rather than Plan 9 hardware
performance. The
[committed-head result](results/2026-09-27-text-scan-multilang/README.md)
contains 206 validated samples across 50 phase/case combinations and predates
generated-Rust participation.
