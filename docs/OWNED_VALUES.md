# Owned values and recoverable failures

This is the target contract for owned `Vec[T]` and a string builder. A scoped
`Vec(T)` subset now supports default initialization (including locals in the
portable VM), checked indexing, fallible `VecPush`, `VecClear`, `VecFree`,
`VecSwap`, `VecPop` and `VecGet` results carried as `Option(T)` records, a
`Vec(u8)` string builder through `BuilderAppend` and `BuilderFinish`, an
explicit `VecClone(dest, src)` with a recoverable failure result, and
`VecSlice(values, low, high)` borrowed views, in C99,
C++, Go, and the portable VM. A vector can live in a local, global, record
field, or fixed-array element reached from a record. Direct vector bindings,
whole aggregates containing vectors, vector-bearing record-literal fields, and
plain record-member paths rooted at a local aggregate have move checks on
declaration, assignment, argument passing, and return. Go can report capacity overflow but
its runtime may terminate on physical allocation failure; this is not yet the
full recoverable failure contract below. `VecPop` and `VecGet` require the
`Option` record template from `std/option.zi` to be visible in the using module.

**Current safety limits:** C99, C++, Go, and the portable VM drop direct owned
`Vec` locals and parameters at block close, return, break, and continue. They
also recursively drop vectors reachable through record fields and fixed arrays.
A direct move clears its source before the next drop; an aggregate move clears
every reachable vector field in native targets, while the portable VM clones at
the destination boundary and relies on the checker to make the source
unreachable. Moving a plain record-member path clears only that field in native
targets and invalidates only the corresponding VM storage slot. An aggregate
move source must be a whole local binding or fresh call result; a member move
must be rooted at a local aggregate. A record literal can initialize a
vector-bearing field from a local vector or fresh call result; using that
source again is rejected. Indexed and pointer-backed member paths, and paths
rooted at a global, remain whole-aggregate/global move errors. A direct or
record-held `TextView` rejects mutation of its local backing place until the
view leaves scope, including views returned by checked calls and views nested
in their result records. The check is field-sensitive: sibling record fields
remain writable, while the borrowed field, its array storage, and whole
aggregate replacement are rejected. A view-bearing global conservatively keeps
its global backing aliases for the rest of the program: assignment from local
or parameter-backed storage is rejected, and mutation of a tracked backing
global is rejected in any function. A view reached through a local pointer created
with Jai `*value` protects its pointee binding and pointer aliases while live.
Local copies of pointer parameters keep the parameter's backing identity.
`TextView` through an opaque local pointer is rejected when its backing lifetime
cannot be proved. Aliases between separate pointer parameters and arbitrary
host boundaries still need coverage. The current origin summary tracks every global in the program. The
rest of this page describes the intended contract, not a guarantee that every
case is enforced today.

A fresh `Vec` call result used as a whole expression statement is dropped
immediately. A result used for member or index access must first be bound to a
local so its lifetime is explicit; an ordinary call can consume the fresh
result directly.

`BuilderFinish` consumes the builder: the returned `string` keeps the builder's
bytes without copying them on native C/C++/Rust when nonempty. Those targets
still retain nonempty finished bytes for process lifetime; they now release
reserved storage when the result is empty. Go copies into its immutable string
representation. The VM copies into an owned snapshot, preserves its owner
through aliases and ranges, and collects unused snapshots at safe statement
and call boundaries. Appending an empty string always succeeds
without allocating.

Generic
`Option` and `Result` are currently ordinary records with explicit status
fields, applied as `Name :: Option(T)` or `Name :: Result(T, E)`. They copy
their fields. Fixed arrays and borrowed slices remain value and view types,
respectively.

## Values and ownership

Scalars, immutable strings, and aggregates whose members are copyable retain
value-copy semantics. An owned value, including `Vec[T]`, should move on assignment,
argument passing, and return. A move source must be a local binding, a plain
record-member path rooted at a local aggregate, or a fresh call result. The
checker rejects moving indexed or pointer-backed member storage and moving a
global, because their aliases cannot yet be represented precisely enough. The
checker rejects use after move and assignment over a direct or aggregate-held
owned vector; moves inside an `if` whose every arm returns do not reach the
join. The target rule is that every path drops each owned local exactly once,
with a moved source zeroed so a later drop is harmless. All current backends
implement this for direct `Vec` bindings, plain record-member paths, and
recursively owned vectors in records and fixed arrays.
A view declared as `[]T` from
`VecSlice(values, low, high)` borrows its source binding until the view's
scope closes: moving or mutating the source, including `VecPush`, `VecPop`,
`VecClear`, `VecFree`, `VecSwap`, and the string builder operations, is
rejected while the view is live; `VecGet` and `VecClone` sources stay
readable. `VecClone(dest, src)` requires a fresh or moved-from destination
and returns `false` on allocation failure without changing the source.
Native output and the portable VM agree on the observable value of
every moved binding: the source is unreachable after the move.

## Recoverable errors

`Result(T, E)` stores `is_ok`, `value`, and `error`; a caller checks `is_ok`
and handles the error explicitly. `Option(T)` stores `has_value` and `value`.
Neither record has a hidden active case, and the language does not provide
postfix error propagation. An owned error type will need defined move and drop
behavior across all backends before it can be used in a portable `Result`.

## Growable storage

`Vec[T]` owns its allocation and reports length and capacity separately.
Growth checks size overflow and returns an allocation error without changing
the vector. `VecPush` consumes its input on either outcome; `VecPop` removes
the last element and returns `Option(T)`, leaving the vector unchanged when it
is empty. Indexing has the same checked bounds behavior as fixed arrays, and
`VecGet` returns `Option(T)` instead of trapping on an out-of-range index. A
string builder owns UTF-8 bytes in a `Vec[u8]`; `BuilderAppend` can fail, and
`BuilderFinish` consumes the builder without copying its bytes. Immutable
`string` values remain unchanged.

The parser, checker, checked `.zir`, C/C++/Go emitters, portable verifier, VM,
and host boundary implement the direct-vector operations above, with the
ownership and automatic-drop limitations called out at the start of this page.
