# Compiler and standard library guide

[Back to the README](../README.md) · [Implementation status](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)

## Build and test

Run `make` to build the current toolchain and `make check` for its language,
backend, and portable bundle tests. `make check` runs independent test scripts
with four workers by default; set `CHECK_JOBS=1` to run them serially or choose
another positive worker count.

## Compiler commands

The compiler commands are `zi2zir` (including
`--check-only`), `zi2c`, `zi2cpp`, `zi2go`, `zi2rust`, `zi2py`, and `zi2zib`.
`zi-fmt` formats source. `ziran guide` prints a short reference from the
installed compiler, including current safety and target limits.
`ziran capabilities --target=go --json` reports a versioned machine-readable
target summary; see the [capability schema](CAPABILITIES.md).
`ziran api --json --root src src/main.zi` checks an entry and its imports,
then reports their public types and procedure signatures; see the
[API query schema](API_DISCOVERY.md).
`ziran check --lint` also warns about casts a program no longer needs: a cast
to the value's own type, and one that only widens a whole typed initializer,
assignment, argument, or result, which the compiler now widens itself.
It also warns when a byte is compared with a printable character's code
written as a number, as C ports do: `text[i] == 65` reads better as
`text[i] == #char "A"`. And it warns about an integer local that only ever
holds 0 or 1 and is only compared with them, which reads better as a `bool`.
Warnings do not fail the check (`"severity":"warning"` in JSON).
`ziran check|ir|api|inspect|build|bundle|run|fmt` remains a convenience dispatcher
for the same tools. [Cross-target benchmarks](../bench/README.md) measure the
compiler, downstream toolchains, and validated runtime cases separately.

## Generate native code

Use `ziran build --target=c` for C99 output. Add `--exe --entry
module:function` to also compile it into `DIR/module`, a program that runs
that procedure and exits with its integer result; the entry takes nothing or
`(argc: s32, argv: **u8)`, and an exported `main` is used as it is. `CC`,
`CFLAGS` (default `-O2`), `LDFLAGS`, and `LDLIBS` apply as in make. Use
`ziran build --target=py --exe --entry module:function -o DIR` for Python 3.10
source that `python3 DIR` runs; it needs only the standard library. Its C
foreign functions resolve in the running Python process, and `LDLIBS` names
the shared libraries to load for them, as it does for a C build: for example
`LDLIBS=-lcairo ziran build --target=py ...`. Use
`ziran build --target=go --pkg main --exe --entry module:function -o DIR`
for Go output. C foreign procedures with scalar or pointer parameters and
results route through generated cgo adapters; native Go package imports
continue to call those packages directly. C ABI calls need `CGO_ENABLED=1`
and a C compiler. `LDFLAGS` and `LDLIBS` are preserved in the cgo preamble.
Slice, record and variadic C ABI parameters are rejected on Go; modules
can wrap those APIs with scalar and pointer declarations.

Go can also bind a C header directly with `go:C/<relative-header>`. The header
supplies the function declarations and native type layout; generated adapters
do not redeclare its ABI. For example:

```ziran
c :: #system_library "go:C/example/signature.h";
builtin :: #system_library "go:builtin";
Signature :: #type #foreign c "signature";
New :: () -> *Signature #foreign c "signature_new";
Length :: (value: *Signature) -> usize #go_field #foreign c "(*signature).length";
FreeAtReturn :: (value: *Signature) #go_defer #foreign c "signature_free";
NativeAvailable :: () -> bool #foreign builtin "cgo_enabled";
```

Header calls accept scalar values and pointers to scalars or declared C types.
`#go_field` supports native fields and header constants; `#go_defer` preserves
cleanup during returns and panic unwinding. Pass include and library paths to
Go through `CGO_CFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS`, or preserve linker flags at generation
through `LDFLAGS` and `LDLIBS`. Calls still obey cgo's pointer ownership rules.
Header paths cannot be absolute or contain empty, `.` or `..` segments.

Header bindings generate `.cgo.go` and `.nocgo.go` companions. Ordinary Ziran
procedures remain available in either build. `cgo_enabled` reports the native
build setting so application code can choose its unavailable path before a C
call. With `CGO_ENABLED=0`, C pointer types are opaque and C calls panic instead
of fabricating results. Build the generated Go package with `go build .` or
`go run .`, which honor the build tags. Reachable header bindings and native
availability checks require Go; pruning a portable entry can remove them.

The Rust backend also preserves `LDFLAGS` and `LDLIBS` in its generated
Cargo project. Python copies scalar pointer buffers into C storage for a
call, preserves aliases within that call, and copies mutations back. Native
pointer outputs and C-owned scalar buffers remain accessible through the
same pointer API. C libraries that retain Ziran-owned memory after a call
need a copying API or C-owned storage on Python.

Use
`ziran build --target=plan9-c` for the experimental Plan 9 C output path.
Pass `--entry module:function` to a C99 build to retain functions, types,
globals, and constants reachable from that entry. A native host implementation
of a called foreign function is retained when it is among the input modules.
Type-only linked modules emit headers without empty C files. Without `--entry`,
all checked declarations and module C files are emitted as before. Runtime
branches in reachable functions remain; this pass does not specialize them.

`ziran compile-commands DIR` writes `DIR/compile_commands.json` for the C
files in `DIR`, so clangd and other editors can read generated code with the
flags it builds with. `--compiler "cc -O2"` sets the compiler and its extra
flags (default `$CC`, then `cc`), `--include DIR` names Ziran's headers
(default: the pinned toolchain's with `--project`, otherwise the checkout
beside the launcher), and `-o FILE` writes elsewhere.

## Save and inspect checked modules

`ziran ir --entry module:function` saves that reachable checked graph as
per-module `.zir` files before native code generation.
Saved `.zir` files are binary. `ziran inspect path/to/module.zir` shows their
declarations, statements, and checked expression links as readable text;
`ziran inspect --hex path/to/module.zir` shows bytes and offsets. Both views
read the saved file and leave it unchanged.

## Imports

For ordinary imports, pass the entry file and a library directory with
`--module-path DIR` (repeat for multiple directories). `check`, `ir`,
`api`, `build`, and `bundle` load extensionless `#import "module"` dependencies
transitively from `.zi` or saved `.zir`. For example:

```sh
build/bin/zi2zir --check-only --root app --module-path ../kryon/src/ui app/main.zi
```

A package-qualified import such as `#import "kryon/Widgets"` resolves
through the package's dependencies in a `--project` build. Outside a
project, name the package's module directory instead:
`--module-path kryon=../kryon/src/ui` serves `kryon/NAME` imports from that
directory (and only those; repeat it for more directories). A package
builds the same way in both modes when each export has its module's name.

`#import, file "../lib/helper.zi";` loads an explicit source file relative to
the importing file. Saved `.zir` builds resolve its module by name from the
saved IR directory or a module path.
`Helper :: #import "helper";` and
`Helper :: #import, file "../lib/helper.zi";` expose public declarations as
`Helper.Name` without adding them to the unqualified scope.
`Helper :: #import, dir "../lib/helper";` loads that directory's `module.zi`.
An ordinary `#import "helper"` also discovers `helper/module.zi` on a module
search path.
`#load "relative/file.zi";` adds another file to the current module. Loads
can nest, and imports inside loaded files resolve relative to those files.
`#import, string "Value :: () -> s32 { return 42 }";` compiles source text
as a module. It also accepts a raw `#string` body, and
`Generated :: #import, string "...";` exposes its declarations as
`Generated.Name`.

## Foreign functions

Ordinary `#import` accepts a module identifier. C headers are no longer
imported as source modules; foreign procedures use `#system_library` and
`#foreign` declarations.
For a native symbol with an unmangled name, put `#program_export` on its own
line immediately before the function declaration.
Foreign procedures use a Jai-style library declaration and `#foreign`:

```jai
libc :: #system_library "libc";
Abs :: (value: s32) -> s32 #foreign libc "abs";
```

### Go packages

For a Go package, use an explicit `go:` library path. This also supports
standard packages whose import paths contain no slash:

```jai
strings :: #system_library "go:strings";
TrimSpace :: (value: string) -> string #foreign strings "TrimSpace";
```

The Go target emits a direct package call. These declarations remain Go
imports in saved `.zir`; they are not portable host capabilities.

An explicit `#program_export "NativeName"` emits a typed Go function with that
exact name. Checked Ziran calls retain their module-qualified implementation
name. Reserved names and collisions with functions, types, imports and module
startup are rejected; colliding globals and constants keep their generated
private names.

Native Go tests use `_test.zi` files and named exports such as
`#program_export "TestSigning"`. Modules using native `testing` bindings or
named test, fuzz and benchmark exports generate `_test.go` files, including
when their module names need disambiguation. Their native adapters expose
`*testing.T`, `*testing.F`, `*testing.B` or `*testing.M` directly for Go's test
discovery. Test helper modules may import the testing bindings from another
Ziran module. Ordinary Ziran checks without this native boundary retain the
`_test_ziran.go` filename and remain ordinary package code.

To require a package for its native initialization, bind its `init` symbol as a
nullary void procedure:

```ziran
driver :: #system_library "go:example.org/database/driver";
Initialize :: () #foreign driver "init";
```

The generated Go import runs the package's initialization once, before the
generated package's globals. The binding's call then has no work to repeat.
If no types or functions need a named import, the compiler emits a blank import.
Initialization bindings accept no receiver, parameters, results or modifiers.
Keep a call on the entry's dependency path when generating a pruned executable.

Generated Go executable entries carry the same provenance header and output
ownership as other generated files. `--prune-stale` removes an old entry when
the output directory is later generated with `--no-main`.

### Foreign Go types

Declare an opaque Go type alongside the package's foreign procedures:

```jai
json :: #system_library "go:encoding/json";
RawMessage :: #type #foreign json "RawMessage";
Envelope :: struct {
    payload: RawMessage #go_tag "json:\"payload\""
}
```

The Go target emits a type alias, preserving the imported type's identity,
methods, interface behavior and zero value. Ziran can store, pass, return and
assign these values, including across imports. Fields and layout remain opaque:
record literals and `size_of` are unavailable. These declarations require an
explicit `go:` package and are preserved in checked IR. Other targets reject
foreign Go types; an entry build can discard them when they are unused.

A slice can be explicitly converted to or from a foreign Go type whose
underlying storage supports the conversion. The Go compiler checks that
underlying type. Conversions preserve native length, capacity, nil values
and shared backing storage; returned native slices keep that storage alive:

```jai
Wrap :: (value: []u8) -> RawMessage { return cast(RawMessage)value }
Unwrap :: (value: RawMessage) -> []u8 { return cast([]u8)value }
```

Fixed-array casts, slice-to-slice casts and owned vector elements are rejected.

### Go receivers, fields and multiple results

A quoted method expression supplies its receiver as the first parameter.
The receiver must match an opaque type declared from the same Go package:

```jai
sync :: #system_library "go:sync";
Mutex :: #type #foreign sync "Mutex";
Lock :: (value: *Mutex) #foreign sync "(*Mutex).Lock";
Unlock :: (value: *Mutex) #foreign sync "(*Mutex).Unlock";
```

Use `#go_field` before `#foreign` to read a native field through a typed
getter. It takes exactly one receiver and returns the field value. The Go
compiler verifies that the field exists and has the declared storage type:

```jai
http :: #system_library "go:net/http";
Request :: #type #foreign http "Request";
Remote :: (request: *Request) -> string #go_field #foreign http "(*Request).RemoteAddr";
```

A getter without a receiver or parameters reads a native package variable or
constant each time it is called. It preserves native interface identity:

```jai
#import "go_types"
sql :: #system_library "go:database/sql";
NoRows :: () -> Error #go_field #foreign sql "ErrNoRows";
```

Getters cannot return owned vectors or records/slices containing them.
A field accessor with a void return is a setter. It takes a pointer receiver
and one value, or just one value when assigning a package variable:

```jai
time :: #system_library "go:time";
Duration :: #type #foreign time "Duration";
Client :: #type #foreign http "Client";
SetTimeout :: (client: *Client, value: Duration) #go_field #foreign http "(*Client).Timeout";
SetDefault :: (client: *Client) #go_field #foreign http "DefaultClient";
```

Setters cannot take owned storage or a value receiver. The Go compiler checks
the field's type and whether the package value can be assigned. Accessors
cannot use variadic parameters, `#go_results`, or `#go_defer`.
Methods of predeclared Go interfaces use their native receiver spelling,
for example `#foreign builtin "error.Error"` with an `Error` parameter.

Ordinary procedures can implement native Go interfaces with
`#go_method "MethodName"`. The first parameter is a local named record or its
pointer; remaining parameters and the result form the native method signature.
The generated method calls the ordinary Ziran procedure, preserving pointer,
error and panic identity. Method names must be Go identifiers, unique for the
receiver record, and different from its generated field names. Foreign types,
anonymous record aliases, generic procedures and owned vector signatures are
rejected. Go checks interface satisfaction when compiling the generated code.

```jai
Message :: struct { text: string }
Describe :: (message: Message) -> string #go_method "Error" {
    return message.text
}
```

On an ordinary method procedure, `#go_results` flattens a nonempty concrete
result record into native Go multiple results in field order. Its fields must
be named without `using` or owned vectors. Ordinary Ziran calls still receive
that record. C, C++ and the portable VM keep the same ordinary procedure body;
method adapters are Go ABI metadata. Both attributes survive saved IR. Go
executable entry selection retains methods of reachable receiver records for
native interface dispatch.

Use `#go_results` on foreign declarations to pack a Go function's multiple
results into a concrete record. Record fields correspond to Go results in
declaration order, including native error interfaces. It also works with method expressions:

```jai
#import "go_types"
net :: #system_library "go:net";
HostPort :: struct { host: string; port: string; error: Error }
Split :: (address: string) -> HostPort #go_results #foreign net "SplitHostPort";
```

The result record must be nonempty, without owned vectors, `using` fields or
discard fields. Variadic declarations and combinations with `#go_field` are
rejected. Both attributes require explicit Go package targets. Checked IR
stores their typed signatures and attributes; generation from saved IR does
not infer them from diagnostic source text.

The standard modules `sync_go`, `time_go`, `random_go`, `text_go`, `net_go`
and `http_go` expose mutexes, native monotonic timestamps, cryptographic random
bytes, copied byte strings, IP primitives, HTTP request fields and headers.
`atomic_go` provides native `Uint64` counters with atomic `Add` and `Load`.
`http_go` also preserves the native `ResponseWriter` interface and exposes
response headers and `SetHeader`.
`time_go` provides parsing, UTC conversion and formatting while preserving
native `time.Time` values and parse errors. It also provides native ticker
creation, stopping and boxed channel access. `context_go` preserves native
contexts and provides `Background` and the boxed cancellation channel `Done`.
`select_go` builds receive, send and default cases over boxed native channels.
`Select` blocks until a case is ready and returns its index, native reflected
value and receive-success flag. It uses Go's `reflect.Select`; channel direction
and send-value compatibility are checked at runtime. Nil channels disable their
case, closed channels retain their zero-value/false receive result, and multiple
ready cases use Go's selection behavior. These operations require the Go target.
`sql_go` exposes native database,
transaction, row and result handles, nullable strings, row iteration and
transaction cleanup. Declare query, execution and scan bindings with the
argument types required by the application; Go checks those native signatures.
`errors_go` provides native error creation, `Is`, `Unwrap` and exact messages.
SQL and context modules expose their native error sentinels through getters.

### Go deferred foreign calls

Declare a void foreign procedure with `#go_defer` to schedule its native Go
call at the end of the calling function, including panic unwinding:

```jai
#import "sync_go"
sync :: #system_library "go:sync";
UnlockAtReturn :: (value: *Mutex) #go_defer #foreign sync "(*Mutex).Unlock";
Work :: (mutex: *Mutex) {
    Lock(mutex)
    UnlockAtReturn(mutex)
    // Work while the mutex is locked.
}
```

Arguments are evaluated and captured at the call statement. Scheduled calls
run in reverse order when that function returns or panics; a nested block
does not end the schedule. Declare and call the foreign binding in the
function that needs cleanup. A Ziran wrapper would schedule cleanup at the
wrapper's own return.

The binding requires an explicit Go package target, a void result and no
owned vector arguments or variadic parameters. `#go_results`, `#go_field`
and Go predeclared builtins other than typed `call` cannot be combined with this
attribute. Calls must be standalone statements. Checked IR preserves the attribute, and
other targets reject reachable Go bindings. Ordinary Ziran `defer` keeps
its lexical scope cleanup semantics across targets.

Typed `go:builtin` `call` declarations invoke their first procedure argument
with the remaining arguments. The declaration must match that procedure's
parameter and result types and cannot carry owned vector values. A void call
can use `#go_defer` to run application cleanup during native Go panic unwinding:

```jai
builtin :: #system_library "go:builtin";
Cleanup :: #type (completed: *bool) -> void;
CleanupAtReturn :: (callback: Cleanup, completed: *bool) #go_defer #foreign builtin "call";
```

The callback and its arguments are captured when scheduled. Pass a pointer
when cleanup needs to observe a value changed later in the calling function.
Checked IR retains the typed callback and the schedule independently of the
declaration's diagnostic source text.

Typed `go:builtin` `bind` declarations capture one or more leading procedure
arguments and return a procedure for the remaining arguments. The first
parameter is the full procedure type; subsequent parameters match its leading
parameters. The returned procedure matches its remaining parameters and result.
Captured values are copied when binding, so pointers retain shared storage while
later replacement of a value does not alter the capture. Binding never invokes
the procedure; native errors, slices and panic values retain their identity.
Captured parameters, remaining parameters and results cannot contain owned
vectors. C callback types are rejected. These signatures are checked in both
source and saved IR.

Ordinary procedure values also resolve each parameter and result in the
declaring procedure type's module. Imported records, pointers, slices and native
Go interfaces keep their type identity across different import aliases.

```jai
builtin :: #system_library "go:builtin";
Full :: #type (count: *s64, amount: s64) -> s64;
Bound :: #type (amount: s64) -> s64;
Bind :: (callback: Full, count: *s64) -> Bound #foreign builtin "bind";
```

Typed `go:builtin` `retain` declarations return their one argument unchanged
under Go's managed storage lifetime. The parameter and result types must match
and cannot contain owned vectors. This explicit native boundary allows strings,
slices and records read through pointers to escape a procedure while preserving
their original storage and nil values. It does not copy backing data or keep
foreign C allocations alive; such allocations retain their foreign lifetime.

Typed `go:builtin` `spawn` declarations start the first procedure argument in
a native Go goroutine with the remaining arguments. The callback and binding
must return `void`; their parameter types must match and cannot contain owned
vectors. Arguments are captured before starting the goroutine. Native Go
pointer, slice, map and channel storage stays alive under Go's collector;
shared mutation still requires synchronization. `spawn` cannot use `#go_defer`.

Typed `go:builtin` `assert` declarations use `#go_results` and one `Any`
argument. Their result record has exactly two fields: the target value type
and a `bool` indicating whether the native Go type assertion succeeded. A
failed assertion returns the target type's zero value and `false`; a typed
nil can succeed and stays distinct from a nil interface. Asserted slices,
pointers and interfaces retain native storage and identity.

```jai
#import "std/go_types"
builtin :: #system_library "go:builtin";
Worker :: #type (value: s64) -> void;
Start :: (callback: Worker, value: s64) #foreign builtin "spawn";
IntegerAssertion :: struct { value: s64; present: bool }
AsInteger :: (value: Any) -> IntegerAssertion #go_results #foreign builtin "assert";
```

These operations and the `std/channel_go` native channel handles are specific
to Go. `std/context_go.WithCancel` and `WithTimeout` return a native context
and its cancellation function; call `Cancel` to release that context. Schedule
cancellation in the owning function with a typed deferred callback when it
must also run during native panic unwinding. Other targets reject reachable
Go bindings; unused Go-only functions can still be excluded from a portable
bundle.

`io_go` exposes native readers, closable readers, writers and `ReadAll`.
`http_go` supplies request bodies and contexts, bounded body readers and
response status writes. `json_go` supplies JSON validation and streaming
encoders and decoders; `url_go` supplies decoded query values. Native interface
conversions keep the original stream and context objects, and these operations preserve
Go error identity. Schedule `ReadCloser.Close` with `#go_defer` in the function
that owns the stream when cleanup must also run after a panic.

### Go predeclared primitives

Typed foreign declarations in `go:builtin` can allocate Go heap objects and
slices/maps, copy bytes into a string, or read a native length:

```jai
builtin :: #system_library "go:builtin";
Allocate :: () -> *HostPort #foreign builtin "new";
Bytes :: (count: isize, capacity: isize) -> []u8 #foreign builtin "make";
Text :: (value: []u8) -> string #foreign builtin "string";
Length :: (value: []u8) -> isize #foreign builtin "len";
Append :: (values: []u8, value: u8) -> []u8 #foreign builtin "append";
Panic :: (value: Error) #foreign builtin "panic";
```

`new` takes no arguments and derives the allocated type from its pointer
result. `make` derives its slice or map type from the result; slices take a
length and optional capacity, and maps take an optional size hint. `len`
returns `isize` and accepts strings, arrays, slices, maps and declared foreign
Go types whose underlying type supports native `len`. Go compilation checks
the underlying operation for opaque types. These calls need no package import
and retain Go's allocation, zero-value and byte-copy behavior.
`append` takes a slice and one element, returns the same slice type, and keeps
Go's length, capacity and shared backing-storage behavior. Owned vector
elements are rejected; variadic slice expansion is not supported by this binding.
`panic` takes one non-owned value and returns void. It preserves the supplied
native Go value, including error identity, during panic unwinding.

### Go record metadata

Go record fields can carry reflection tags. The checked string is preserved
in saved IR and emitted as a Go struct tag; other targets keep the same fields
and ignore this Go metadata:

```jai
Response :: struct {
    userID: string #go_tag "json:\"user_id\""
    expiresAt: s64 #go_tag "json:\"expires_at,omitempty\""
}
```

Go can preserve an anonymous native struct's identity with `#go_anonymous`
alone in its record body:

```jai
Reply :: struct {
    #go_anonymous
    code: isize #go_tag "json:\"code\""
    message: string #go_tag "json:\"message\""
}
```

The Go declaration is `type Reply = struct { ... }`. Native reflection has
an empty type name, and JSON decoding retains anonymous struct error details.
The annotation preserves ordinary checked Ziran fields and is retained in
saved IR. Other targets keep their ordinary record representation.

### Python modules

The Python target imports Python modules the way the Go target imports Go
packages. Name the module with a `py:` library path; the symbol is an
attribute of that module, dotted for a nested one such as a class method:

```jai
json :: #system_library "py:json";
builtins :: #system_library "py:builtins";
#import "py_types"
Loads :: (text: string) -> Object #foreign json "loads";
FromHex :: (text: string) -> []u8 #foreign builtins "bytes.fromhex";
```

A symbol written `(Type).name` calls the method on the first argument; the
type names the receiver's class for readers:

```jai
Upper :: (text: string) -> string #foreign builtins "(str).upper";
```

Values convert at the boundary by their declared types: `string` becomes
`str` (UTF-8, with invalid bytes round-tripped), `[]u8` becomes `bytes`,
integers and floats stay numbers, and results convert back, integers wrapping
to their declared width. `py_types` declares `Object`, any Python value, with
`null` for `None`; a module may declare narrower foreign types such as
`Response :: #type #foreign request "HTTPResponse";`. A procedure argument
becomes a callable whose arguments and result convert the same way, so Python
can call back into Ziran (`map`, `sorted` keys, handlers).

Slices of strings, booleans, fixed-width numbers, enums, or Python foreign
objects convert to Python lists, and Python iterables convert back to typed
Ziran slices. The container is copied in both directions; Python objects
inside it retain their identity. `[]u8` keeps its bytes conversion. Nested
typed slices are not supported; use `Object` for nested Python containers.

Named arguments on a Python foreign call become Python keyword arguments.
Positional arguments stay positional; all arguments, including a method's
receiver, evaluate in Ziran source order. Bind only the options the call
needs, leaving other Python defaults untouched:

```jai
Dumps :: (obj: Object, sort_keys: bool) -> string #foreign json "dumps";
text := Dumps(value, sort_keys = true)
```

`#py_field` reads an attribute with a result and sets it with one value and
no result. `(Type).name` takes the object first; a plain name is a module
attribute:

```jai
sys :: #system_library "py:sys";
Major :: () -> s32 #py_field #foreign sys "version_info.major";
SetName :: (item: Object, value: string) #py_field #foreign types "(SimpleNamespace).name";
```

A Python exception otherwise stops the program with its traceback, including
the original `.zi` statement locations in executable output. With
`#py_results`, the declared result record catches it: its last field `error`
receives the exception as `"Type: message"` text, or as the exception object
when declared with a foreign Python type, and an optional first field receives
the result on success:

```jai
Loaded :: struct { value: Object; error: string }
TryLoads :: (text: string) -> Loaded #py_results #foreign json "loads";
```

Conversion failures also populate `error`; partial iterable results are not
published. Python `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` retain their usual
behavior.

Python imports stay Python imports in saved `.zir`. Modules that use them
build only for the Python target; the C, C++, Go, and Rust targets reject
them. A module meant for every target gives each target its own
implementation behind one Ziran interface.

### Python-target scripts

Run a script with Python 3.10 or newer in one command:

```sh
ziran run --target=py scripts/task.zi -- --name café
```

The default entry is the input module's `main`; override it with
`--entry module:function`. `.zir` inputs use the same convention. Arguments
after the source file go unchanged to the script, with an optional `--`
separator. In a project, `ziran run --target=py -- ARGS` uses its manifest
entry, dependency map, and pinned toolchain. Compiler options precede the
source file. `--python PATH` or `ZIRAN_PYTHON` selects the interpreter;
otherwise the launcher uses `python3` from `PATH`.

The launcher caches generated Python under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ziran/python`
(or `$HOME/.cache/ziran/python`). Its content key includes the compiler,
entry, flags, sources, module search trees, standard library, package map,
and link configuration. New modules that shadow earlier imports invalidate
the cache. Failed builds do not run stale output. `--no-cache` compiles every
time. Sources containing `#load` also compile every time because loaded files
can be outside the module roots. Imported Python libraries remain runtime
dependencies; Python files beside the original script are on `PYTHONPATH`.

`std/args_py` exposes arguments and the original script filename. A script
may start with a shebang and be made executable with `chmod +x`:

```jai
#!/usr/bin/env -S ziran run --target=py
Args :: #import "std/args_py";
Process :: #import "std/process_py";

#program_export
main :: () -> s32 {
    parser := Args.Parser("Run a command")
    Args.AddText(parser, "--message", fallback = "hello")
    options := Args.Parse(parser)
    message := Args.Text(options, "message")
    command: [2]string = .["echo", message]
    result := Process.Run(command[:])
    if result.error != "" { print("%\n", result.error); return 1 }
    print("%", result.stdout)
    return result.code
}
```

The scripting modules are ordinary Ziran APIs over Python's standard library:

- `std/args_py`: arguments, flags, text and integer options, repeatable text
  options, parsing, and the original script filename.
- `std/collections_py`: typed iterable copies, dictionary access, scalar
  boxing, and an iterator with a separate `done` flag so `None` remains data.
- `std/map_py`: explicit copies between Python dictionaries and portable
  `HashMap(string, string)` or `HashMap(string, s64)` values.
- `std/file_py`: UTF-8 text, bytes, paths, sorted recursive globs, temporary
  directories, copying, renaming, and removal. File operations return errors.
- `std/process_py`: argument lists, cwd, environment, stdin, output capture,
  timeouts, executable lookup, and preserved Python exceptions. `Run` checks
  exit status by default; set `allow_failure` to receive a nonzero code
  without an error. `inherit_output` passes both streams to the parent.
  Child environments omit `DISPLAY` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` unless
  `inherit_desktop` is explicitly set; the supplied environment is copied.
- `std/json_py`: parsing, Unicode output, sorted keys, and pretty printing.
- `std/regex_py`: search, capture-aware results, replacement, and whole-match
  iteration. `FindTexts` returns `Vec(string)` and raises on invalid patterns;
  the other operations return errors.
- `std/text_py`: Unicode case conversion, stripping, splitting, joining,
  replacement, and byte conversion. Ziran string indexing still counts bytes.
- `std/time_py`: wall-clock and monotonic time, sleep, and UTC ISO timestamps.

These modules require the Python target. The Python interpreter and any
third-party libraries still need to be installed. See
`scripts/build_playground.zi` for a maintained build tool using these APIs.

### Host capabilities and visibility

Ziran also resolves `host_api :: #system_library "host_api";` to its host
capability bridge. `ziran bundle --bind caller:capability=provider:function`
can satisfy a portable host capability with an exported Ziran function in the
bundle; the provider must have the same signature. `--bind-host MODULE`
binds every remaining capability to MODULE's exported function of the same
name, as a C program links a host's symbols by name, so one Ziran host module
serves `ziran bundle` and the Go, Rust, and Python targets alike.
Use `#scope_file`, `#scope_module`, and `#scope_export` to change the
visibility of following declarations.

## Multiline strings

Raw multiline text uses Jai's `#string` delimiter form. The body keeps its
whitespace and the newline before the closing delimiter:

```jai
Greeting :: #string END
Hello, "world"!
END;
```

## Standard library

Import a standard module as `#import "std/text"`. In a project the pinned
toolchain supplies it. A standalone command searches its `--module-path`
directories first and then the standard modules that came with the
compiler: `std` beside an installed toolchain (`make install-user` copies it),
otherwise the checkout the compiler was built from. `ZIRAN_STD=DIR` names
another standard directory. The short spelling `#import "text"` also works
when no module of your own has that name.
Dependencies from other Git repositories import the same way, as
`#import "NAME/Module"`; see [Packages](PACKAGES.md).

### Building text

`std/format.zi` builds text on an owned `Vec(u8)` builder. `Append(*builder,
value)` adds a string, integer, bool, or float, and
`BuilderPrint(*builder, "% of %\n", done, total)` appends a formatted piece:
each `%` takes the next argument and `%%` writes one percent. A file that uses
`BuilderPrint` imports `std/format` automatically, and `std/format` makes
`Vec` visible. `BuilderFinish(builder)` returns the text. Floats keep up to six
digits after the point, with trailing zeros dropped.

### Hash maps

`std/hash_map.zi` maps string or integer keys to values on every target and
the portable runner:

```jai
#import "std/hash_map"

ages: HashMap(string, s32)
HashMapSet(*ages, "ada", 36)       // insert or replace
age: s32
if HashMapGet(*ages, "ada", *age) { print("%\n", age) }
HashMapRemove(*ages, "ada")        // returns whether the key was present
HashMapFree(*ages)
```

`HashMapHas` tests a key and `ages.count` is the number of entries. The table
doubles when half its slots are in use. Values may be records; keys are
`string`, `s64`, `u64`, or `u32` (and narrower unsigned integers). The Go
target's native `Map(K, V)` from `std/map_go` is separate and keeps its
`MapSet`/`MapGet` operations.

### Text and UTF-8

`std/text.zi` supplies ASCII case folding, prefix matching, and substring
matching over immutable UTF-8 strings. Non-ASCII bytes compare unchanged. These
functions use only portable Ziran operations, so the same source builds for C,
C++, Go, and `.zib`. Add `--module-path std` when importing it from an app.
`std/string_range.zi` provides `Substring(source, start, length)` over borrowed
bytes, using Ziran's checked `source[low:high]` string range syntax. Choose
UTF-8 codepoint boundaries when the result must remain valid text.

`std/utf8.zi` advances through UTF-8 scalar boundaries and counts codepoints.
Invalid bytes advance one byte, which keeps a scanner moving while preserving
valid multibyte sequences.

### Generic values

`std/option.zi` and `std/result.zi` define generic records. Import a
template and create a concrete type with `Number :: Option(s32)` or
`Outcome :: Result(s32, string)`. An `Option` has `has_value` and `value`
fields; a `Result` has `is_ok`, `value`, and `error` fields. Check the status
field explicitly before reading the associated value.

`std/pair.zi` defines a generic record. Import it and write
`PairNumberText :: Pair(s32, string)` to create a concrete record
with `first: s32` and `second: string` fields.

A polymorphic procedure binds its type parameter through a direct `$T`, a
slice `[]$T`, a fixed array `[N]$T`, or a pointer `*$T` parameter: `Sum :: (values: []$T) -> T`
specializes for whatever element type the caller passes. A generic record
parameter binds its arguments too: `Add :: (bag: *Bag($K), item: K)` called
with a `*Bag(string)` binds `K` to `string`.

`Copy :: (values: [3]$T) -> [3]T { return values; }` infers `T` while
requiring exactly three elements. The capacity may be a compile-time constant
or expression from the procedure's module; it is not inferred from the caller.
Zero-capacity arrays retain their declared element type. Array parameters keep
ordinary value semantics, so changing a parameter does not change the caller's
array. Nested-array element types work natively; the portable linker rejects
nested-array returns that its runtime cannot represent yet.

### Sorting and queues

`std/sort.zi` sorts any slice whose elements support `<` in place with
`Sort(values[:])`, and searches a sorted slice with `LowerBound` and
`BinarySearch`. Sorting allocates nothing and is not stable.

`std/queue.zi` is an allocation-free bounded byte FIFO. Queue state is passed
and returned by value, and every operation receives the caller-owned backing
storage explicitly. Full pushes and empty pops are rejected without unwinding
the queue; partial byte pops report the number removed.

### JSON and ZIP

`std/json_scan.zi` supplies allocation-free JSON value skipping, object member
and array element lookup, string spans, and decimal number reading. It validates
the value shape and escapes while scanning; member names match unescaped ASCII
bytes. Callers keep the original input string and use byte offsets returned by
the scanner. Its tests compare source and saved-IR portable bundles, and the
same module is exercised through native C, C++, and Go by a downstream client.

`std/zip.zi` reads classic ZIP directories from caller-owned bytes, verifies
stored entries with CRC-32, and writes stored archives into caller-owned output.
It rejects split, encrypted, and malformed archives, and duplicate requested
entries. ZIP64 archives are unsupported.
It runs in portable bundles. `std/zip_linux.zi` adds raw DEFLATE extraction
through the system zlib library for 64-bit Linux native C builds; link those
builds with `-lz`. The caller supplies file I/O, memory limits, and which entry names
are meaningful to the application.
`std/zip_file_linux.zi` writes stored ZIP entries directly to a caller-owned
file from borrowed byte slices, including mapped files. The caller controls
file creation and publication. Its test checks the output with Python's ZIP
reader as well as Ziran's reader.

### HTTP and process capabilities

`std/net_http.zi` defines an explicit request/response host capability. A
platform adapter supplies transport and TLS; checked Ziran code owns request
construction and response interpretation. A missing host binding is reported
before a portable bundle runs.

`std/constant_time.zi` compares equal-length byte spans without branching on
byte values. Use fixed-size buffers for secret tags so unequal lengths remain
public shape rather than a secret-dependent oracle.

`std/process.zi` defines a line-oriented child-process capability with explicit
arguments, stdin, an optional credential binding, a timeout, and a desktop
isolation request. The host starts the child, yields output lines, and returns
its exit result. Its contract runs from source and saved `.zir` as a portable
bundle and through native C, C++, and Go mocks.

### Files

`#import "std/file"` gives one set of file operations on every native C
target: it uses `std/file_linux.zi` on Linux, Android, the web, and Windows,
and `std/file_plan9.zi` for `--target=plan9-c`, which defines `PLAN9` for
`#if #defined(PLAN9)`. The shared operations are `OpenRead`, `OpenWrite`,
`OpenUpdate`, `OpenReplace`, `Read`, `Write`, `ReadAt`, `WriteAt`,
`FileSize`, `CloseFile`, `RemoveFile`, `RenameNoReplace`, `PathExists`,
`DirectoryExists`, `CreateDirectory`, `CreatePrivateDirectory`, and the
directory cursor. Two helpers read and replace whole files:

```jai
#import "std/file"

if WriteEntireFile("notes.txt", "hello\n") {
    text, ok := ReadEntireFile("notes.txt")
}
```

The Go target and portable bundles do not have these operations; Go
programs use `std/file_go`.

### Native Plan 9 files

Native `plan9-c` builds can import `std/file_plan9.zi` for positional byte
reads and writes, file size, read/update/replace handles, private files,
directory checks and creation, removal, and renaming without replacement.
`RenameNoReplace` changes only a basename within the same directory; it
rejects cross-directory moves. Paths reject embedded NUL bytes and must fit
the adapter's 4096-byte C buffer. These operations use native Plan 9 libc
and are not portable host capabilities. `tests/file_plan9.sh` checks source
and saved IR generation; TaijiOS's `rill-ziran-plan9-smoke` gate compiles
and runs the fixture with native `8c`/`8l`.

### Native Linux adapters

Native Linux C builds can import `std/file_linux.zi` for positional byte I/O,
`std/binary_linux.zi` for little-endian numbers, `std/date_time_linux.zi` for
Unix time, `std/random_linux.zi` for operating-system secure randomness, and
`std/byte_text_linux.zi` for borrowed byte-to-text views. `std/socket_linux.zi`
opens literal-IPv4 TCP sockets with bounded polling, cancellation, and I/O.
`std/timer_linux.zi` supplies monotonic millisecond timestamps and bounded,
interruptible sleeps; it does not expose wall-clock time.
`std/thread_linux.zi` runs a procedure on a background thread that the
starting thread can poll for completion without waiting, which suits a frame
loop with a request in flight; it builds on pthreads, including Android's.
`ThreadStart` also accepts an optional `ThreadNotification` containing a
`procedure` and its `argument`.
The worker calls that notification once after publishing completion, allowing
an event loop or pipe waiter to wake immediately. The notification must not
join or restart its own thread. Keep the thread and argument storage alive
until `ThreadFinished` or `ThreadWait` joins it before consuming results.
The file module can create a private file exclusively, sync its contents, and
publish it through a hard link that fails if the destination already exists.
`std/byte_text_linux.zi` also borrows caller-owned C strings and byte buffers;
the caller must keep their memory alive. `std/mapped_file_linux.zi` maps a file
privately for bounded byte parsing without copying it. Its borrowed slice is
valid only until `UnmapFile`, and writes to that slice do not change the file.
`std/process_capture_linux.zi` captures a child process without a shell;
`std/net_http_linux.zi` uses it to send JSON over HTTPS through `curl`.
These native adapters keep libc calls out of applications and require glibc
Linux and a `curl` executable. Portable bundles should use the host capabilities
above instead.

Windows C builds (`--define _WIN32`) keep the same file and mapping API over
Win32. Paths pass as UTF-8 and are converted to UTF-16. Positional reads and
writes leave the file position unchanged, as on POSIX, and a private mapping
is a copy-on-write view. An open file can itself be renamed or removed, but
unlike POSIX, a rename cannot replace a destination that is still open. The
libcurl HTTP and WebSocket adapters also build there; `std/zip_linux.zi` needs
a MinGW zlib. `tests/std_file_windows.sh` links the file modules with MinGW
and runs them under Wine when both are installed.

### Native Go maps

Import `map_go` to use `Map(K, V)` with the Go target. Keys must be comparable;
values cannot own `Vec` storage. A map's zero value is nil. Copies share entries,
while replacing a map binding changes only that binding. Maps can be compared
with `null`, and their contents are accessed through these operations:

| Operation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `MapInit(values)` | Allocate an empty map if the binding is nil |
| `MapSet(values, key, value)` | Insert or replace; allocate nil storage first |
| `MapGet(values, key)` | Read an entry, or return the value type's zero value |
| `MapLookup(values, key)` | Return `Option(V)`; import `option` to use this operation |
| `MapContains(values, key)` | Test key presence, including entries with zero values |
| `MapDelete(values, key)` | Remove an entry; missing keys are harmless |
| `MapClear(values)` | Remove every entry while preserving allocated storage |
| `MapCount(values)` | Return the entry count as `s64` |
| `MapKeys(values)` | Return an unordered `[]K` snapshot |

`MapInit` and `MapSet` require a mutable binding or field. Nil maps support
reads, membership checks, deletion and clearing. Map mutation in `#parallel`
regions is rejected because copies share storage. Other targets and portable
ABIs reject maps; checked `.zir` preserves their Go behavior.

Import `go_types` for the predeclared Go `Any` and `Error` interfaces. `Any`
accepts values that do not own `Vec` storage, including nested maps for JSON.

### Native civil clocks and calendars

Import `date_time_linux` or `date_time_plan9` for `UnixNow()`, `LocalNow()`,
`LocalAt(seconds)`, and `UtcAt(seconds)`. `LocalAt` uses the operating system's
timezone and daylight-saving rules. The shared `LocalDateTime` record lives
in `date_time_types`; the hosted `date_time` module re-exports that same type.
Months and days are one-based, `day_of_year` is zero-based, and `valid` reports
whether the provider could obtain a reading. Native Plan 9 libc accepts
unsigned 32-bit epoch seconds, covering 1970 through early 2106; values outside
that range return an invalid reading. Dates after 2038 retain their full value.

Import `calendar` for Gregorian `LeapYear`, `DaysInMonth`, `DayOfWeek`,
`DayOfYear`, `DateTimeValid`, and `FormatDateTime`. `DayOfWeek` returns zero for
Sunday and minus one for an invalid date. Calendar dates range from year 1 to
9999. `FormatDateTime(reading, pattern, output)` writes into a caller-owned
byte slice, leaves a NUL terminator, and returns a view of the complete result.
Invalid readings, unsupported tokens, and insufficient space return an empty
view and clear the first output byte. Names are English and independent of
locale. Supported civil tokens are `%a`, `%A`, `%b`, `%B`, `%h`, `%C`, `%d`,
`%e`, `%F`, `%D`, `%H`, `%I`, `%j`, `%k`, `%m`, `%M`, `%p`, `%P`, `%r`, `%R`,
`%S`, `%T`, `%u`, `%w`, `%X`, `%y`, `%Y`, `%n`, `%t`, and `%%`. The calendar
calculations and formatting also run from portable bundles without a clock
host.
