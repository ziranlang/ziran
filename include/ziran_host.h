 * Modify elements in place and keep the elements pointer and length intact;
 * the VM validates and copies every element back after the call. Returned
 * fields and string bytes must remain valid until BundleRun returns.

 * A returned zero-length slice may have a null elements pointer. Longer

 * in `pointer`; the VM treats it as an opaque handle and never dereferences
 * it, so the host owns the storage behind it. */
